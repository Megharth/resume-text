% A multiplayer Checkers web-game with chat-room and game-room support. The goal
% was to achieve \textasciitilde{}0\% lag and make game backups while supporting
% multiple games on the server. Accomplished this by implementing Sockets that
% guarantee real-time updates under stable network connection and Genservers that
% stores the state of the game after every move. \\

% A Raspberry Pi based prototype of eye controlled wheelchair which enables
% locomotion of wheelchair using the user's eye. Aimed to achieve accurate
% interpretations of user's actions and respond with minimum latency. Used
% algorithms to detect the gestures of the eye, with the help of OpenCV library.
% And reduced the latency between motors and Pi using L-293D H-bridge. Gained
% \textasciitilde{}95\% accuracy and \textasciitilde{}20\% latency.\\
