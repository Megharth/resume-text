% A multiplayer Checkers web-game with chat-room and game-room support. The goal
% was to achieve \textasciitilde{}0\% lag and make game backups while supporting
% multiple games on the server. Accomplished this by implementing Sockets that
% guarantee real-time updates under stable network connection and Genservers that
% stores the state of the game after every move. \\
